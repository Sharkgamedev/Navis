    \"No, why might you be asking that?\"\nEsmerelda: \"Well, I personally think
    that this Transatlantic Migration happening at this time, isn\u2019t the smartest.
    The black death was so scary for so long and then all of a sudden everyone is
    moving around again. I never know if someone is still carrying this disease!\""
