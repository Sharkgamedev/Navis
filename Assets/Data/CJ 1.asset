  ConversationText: "Chester: \u201CYou said you thought they were going to work
    you. For what end?\u201D\r\nCarlile:\u201CSugar I\u2019d reckon. Pretty popular
    in Europe them\u2019s say.\u201D\r\nJ \u201CLet\u2019s go, he\u2019s a liar anyway,
    no way to kill the indians that fast.\u201D\r\nCarlile: \u201CYou get off me
    eh, I\u2019m done talking if he\u2019s gonna be here.\u201D\r\nChester: \u201CNo
    hear him out, how do you reckon they killed that many?\u201D\r\nCarlile: \u201CIt
    wasn\u2019t all purposeful, we just got Black Death and we got plenty of other
    ails that they don\u2019t have no experience with.\u201D\r\nJ \u201CYou believe
    in that immunity thing huh? He\u2019s crazy, we\u2019re wasting time.\u201D\r\nCarlile:\u201CI
    aint finished, those disease, they done killed the lot of them. That and the
    conquest, taking their land forcefully least I aint lying if it\u2019s wrong,
    that\u2019s just what I\u2019ve been told and you can\u2019t trust rumour but
    you gotta listen when there aint no alternative.\u201D\r\nChester: \u201CYeah?
    Thanks for your cooperation here. Last thing, anybody able to vouch for your
    location at the time of the murder?\u201D\r\nCarlile:\u201CNah, not that I know
    of. But I aint killing him. He left me alone I leave him alone you know. If that
    Thomas Holland turned up dead you could lock me up on the spot, but Alexi? No.\u201D\r\nChester:\u201CLock
    you up on the spot? Why is that?\u201D\r\nCarlile: \u201CI\u2019ve seen what
    those slave owners do. Before I was taken we were already struggling. Don\u2019t
    have enough working men, and the fighting and wars, the hiding out, I haven\u2019t
    seen anyone under 10 year's since this \u2018New World\u2019 was discovered.
    Now I\u2019m on this so called \u2018middle leg\u2019 headed to my doom, held
    against my will after those slavers already caused me and my home so much pain.
    All of it \u2018neccecary\u2019 to replace the Indians they accidently slaughtered?
    Yeah I wanna kill im\u2019 alright. No point in hiding it, least if I go to jail
    I shan\u2019t be worked to death.\u201D\r\nChester: \u201CThank you for your
    time.\u201D\r"
