  OpeningText: "Chester: \u201CExcuse me, do you have a moment?\u201D\nCarlile: \u201CI\u2019ve
    got nothing but time, at least until we get where it is that we're going. Speaking
    of you wouldn\u2019t have been topside in the past few days. Happen to see any
    land or hints to where we are up there?\u201D\nChester: \u201CNo sir, I\u2019m
    sorry.\u201D\nCarlile: \u201CNobody comes to chat, what is it you need?\u201D\nChester:
    \u201CI\u2019m looking into the murder of Alexi, you know anything about it?\u201D\nCarlile:
    \u201CSure do. Poor chap, something wasn\u2019t right in that head of his, though.\u201D\nChester:
    \u201CDid you see anything suspicious around the time of his murder? That\u2019d
    be about 2 days ago for reference.\u201D\nCarlile: \u201CNot like I know when
    a day passes locked up in here, but yeah I saw something. I saw a lot in fact.
    Watched his figure drop right overboard through that window right there. Good
    way to ruin the one day you get above. Had a spear or harpoon sticking up from
    his chest. Didn\u2019t get much a good look at him. Couldn\u2019t see the man
    who pushed him over either.\nChester: \u201CWhat makes you believe it was a man?\u201D\nCarlile:
    \u201CYou don\u2019t see many a woman on this ship do ya? Regardless I heard
    \u2018im grunting as he shoved \u2018im over. That ain't no lady.\u201D\nChester:
    \u201CThank you, may I ask a few questions about you now?\u201D\nCarline: \u201CNot
    like I\u2019ve got much will to resist.\u201D\nChester: \u201CWhat are you doing
    on this ship?\u201D\nCarlile: \u201CSame as everyone else, eh? Going to the New
    World for riches and fame. C\u2019ept I ain't going on my own accord, and the
    riches and fame I ought to work for ain't going to me.\u201D\nChester: \u201CThey
    don\u2019t have enough muscle over there already?\u201D\n\u201CDid. They done
    killed em\u2019 all off. Overworked em\u2019 the lot of \u2018em. At least, that\u2019s
    what I\u2019ve been hearing. I only get rumours and scraps, they keep me in the
    dark and don\u2019t feed me, make sure I don\u2019t rebel yeah?\u201D\nJefferson:
    \u201CYou wasting your time with scum he doesn\u2019t know anything let\u2019s
    get eh?\u201D"
