  ConversationText: "Thomas: \u201CWell why didn\u2019t you just say that! What happened
    to that poor man is terrible, but unless one of my many slaves is at the foot
    of this issue there is no need to suspect me or anyone of my servants as a murderer.
    Especially after we have lost so many people from disease and land destruction
    during the Translatlantic Migration rise especially those of colour!\u201D\nChester:
    \u201CI understand what you're saying sir, but have you seen anything suspicious
    from anyone else on this boat?\u201D \nJ: \u201CChester, I\u2019m serious, this
    guy gives me a weird vibe, you should convict him of manslaughter.\u201D\nThomas:
    \u201CHey, don\u2019t go running your mouth like that!\u201D\nChester: \"Jefferson!
    This is absurd stop interfering!\u201D \nThomas: \"Now that I think of it, I
    did see someone holding a harpoon while talking to Alexi the day of the murder\u201D\nChester:
    \u201CCan you give me more detail on that?\u201D\nThomas: \u201CThat\u2019s all
    I will say until my lawyer is present.\u201D\nJ: \u201CWhat did I tell you ches.
    that guy is just a slave owner, I knew he would ask for a lawyer.\u201D\nThomas:
    \"Don\u2019t call me that.\""
