    \"Well, you and I both know that the Columbian Exchange has brought us so many
    new amazing resources, but for us plantation owners, it hasn't been easy. I mean,
    Columbus said that their islands would be easy to take over and contain fantastic
    crops, but while the crops are good, it's costed us dearly to wage war against
    the natives. However, the Columbian exchange has been a good thing for us with
    a bad outcome for the natives, not like I care anyway.\"\nChester: \"I totally
    understand.\"\nCamille: \"And this whole murder thing is widespread. I have felt
    very threatened by Jefferson he just stares at you and makes you feel so uncomfortable.
    He really is suspicious, that guy. I know he\u2019s your sideman and all but
    maybe you should interview him?\"\nChester: \"Yes, ma'am don't worry he will
    be interviewed, I can totally for sure promise you.\"\nCamille: \"Good, he should
    be, he seems guilty.\""
