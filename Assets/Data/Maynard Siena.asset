    \u201CWhy yes of course! Oh, is this about that Alexi, I feel so bad for him\u2026\u201D\nChester:
    \u201CIt is. Why are you on this boat ma'am?\nMaynard: \u201CMe? Oh, I\u2019m
    travelling with my husband - he\u2019s not on this boat though.\u201D\nChester:
    \u201CHave you seen anything suspicious recently?\u201D\nMaynard: \u201CNo, nothing
    I can think of, I\u2019m sorry.\"\nChester: \"You're sure? Nothing around two
    or so days ago?\"\nMaynard: \"No sir, I'm sorry. I was eating dinner below deck
    at the time, the whole boat was actually. That's the last time I saw him too,
    you know. He got up and left at dinner, to go to the bathroom I suppose.\""
